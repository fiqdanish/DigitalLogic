<h1>Digital Logic</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Digital electronics is the foundation of all microprocessor-based systems found in
computers, robots, automobiles, and industrial control systems. This course introduces the
students to digital electronics and provides a broad overview of many important concepts,
components, and tools. Students will get up-to-date coverage of digital fundamentals-from
basic concepts to programmable logic devices. Laboratory experiments provide hands-on
experience with the simulator software, actual devices and circuits studied in the
classroom.
